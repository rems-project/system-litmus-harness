      description: >
        fixed race condition in locking in the harness that could sometimes
        cause the tool to deadlock.  Whether it caused other issues is unknown.

        Fixed sync handlers. It used to set the sync handler for the incorrect (non-existent) thread.
        Also the handler had no ERET.

    - test: check1 check2
      description: >
        fixed case where if _both_ loads faulted then the second load's exception handler would also fault
        causing the entire harness to crash.
        More generally tests need to be more resilient to unexpected faults and have more detection.

  errata:
  - test: '@pgtable'
    description: >
      insufficient locking around vmm_ensure_level meant that during per-thread initialization
      of the state could mean we could have returned a pointer to an entry that was subsequently
      overwritten by another vmm_ensure_level call leaving it dangling and irrelevant.

  errata:
  - test: WWR.NC+po-po
    description: >
      Missing .no_interesting_results meant the harness thought it had 0 interesting results,
      so if they occured, they would not be tagged as interesting.
